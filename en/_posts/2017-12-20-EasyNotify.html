<h3>What is EasyNotify?</h3>
<p>
EasyNotify is a note reminder app for android devices. The purpose of the app is to organize notes as easy as possible. You can add the so called 'Notifys' to lists. The app will display a permanent notification of each list in the notification bar, so that you will always see your notes when you get a message or something similiar. Besides that there is a reminder service with which you can create a Notify with a reminder time at for example 1 p.m. every day. The app will then send you a notification at that point of time. Of course one can choose the interval of the reminder.
Currently, the app has over 50,000 downloads and over 1,000 ratings with an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.

<h3>What were my tasks during the project?</h3>
<p>
Of course I had to program the app, but at the beginning it had only limited functionality. Because of good suggestions from the user base, I implemented more and more featues. The GUI changed over time, as well as the whole database structure. Besides this, I tried to make the animations as logical as possible, to maximize the usability.

The website is a separate project. The purpose of the website is to give an overview over the app's features, but also to provide a contact form for questions and error reports. The page is completely responsive and made with the slim PHP framework.
