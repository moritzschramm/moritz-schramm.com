<h3>What is Typos?</h3>
<p>Typos is an online trainer with which one can learn the touch typing system.
</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
One can choose between lections and training sessions. The app loads the training content and displays a virtual keyboard that shows which keys to press. More experienced users can also hide the keyboard.
The app saves the speed and the accuracy of the user in the background. Commonly misspelled words will be asked more frequently in future sessions. Users can also create own lections and practice with them.
</p>
<h3>What were my tasks?</h3>
<p>
I programmed the first draft in Java, but I had later the idea to make the project available for everybody.
After I had the database structure, I started to program the main application and designed the layout of the page. I used the Laravel framework to build the app. Right now, there is only the 'static' version available (only the app with random articles)
